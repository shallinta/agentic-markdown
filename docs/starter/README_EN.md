# Electrobun App Starter

A production-shaped starter for building a native macOS desktop app with
[Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev), React, TypeScript, Bun, Tailwind CSS, and
shadcn/ui.

The repository provides the reusable application shell so you can start with
your product instead of rebuilding desktop plumbing. It intentionally contains
no product-specific domain logic, hosted web app, telemetry, proxy settings, or
embedded Chromium edition.

<!-- i18n: included -->

## Included

- An Electrobun main process and a Vite-powered React renderer.
- A typed RPC boundary and command routing between the two runtime contexts.
- Native window and menu management, persisted window state, a collapsible
  sidebar, and safe external link handling.
- Full-screen state RPC, renderer subscription infrastructure, and a maximize
  command; downstream apps mount custom title-bar UI only when needed.
- An internationalized shell with live `en-US`/`zh-CN` switching and Bun-owned
  locale persistence, plus theme, primary-color, update, and about settings.
- Automatic-update infrastructure and macOS release workflows for Apple
  Silicon and Intel.
- An opt-in local CEF/CDP diagnostic command; normal development and every
  release build continue to use the system WebView.
- A shared UI package with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui primitives.
- Bun tests, TypeScript checks, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and GitHub Actions.

<!-- i18n: feature-catalog -->

## Feature catalog

The [English feature catalog](../FEATURES_EN.md) separates capabilities
connected to the default app shell from optional modules that a downstream
product must deliberately connect, and its header links to Chinese. Source code
existing does not mean a capability is enabled, packaged, registered, or
released by default; native file operations and the deep-link template, for
example, remain disconnected.

<!-- i18n: requirements -->

## Requirements

- macOS
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) (recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.com) if you do not use mise

<!-- i18n: getting-started -->

## Get started

Clone the repository, then install the locked toolchain and dependencies:

```bash
mise run setup
```

Start the desktop app with Vite HMR:

```bash
mise run dev
```

Changes to the React renderer are updated through HMR. Restart the command after
changing Bun main-process code.

<!-- i18n: create-your-app -->

## Create a new app from the Starter

When using this project as a new product base, isolate app identity, local data,
and public URLs before product development, then finish signing, notarization,
and permission configuration before the first release. The
[Create a new app from the Starter guide](../CREATE_YOUR_APP_EN.md) owns
execution order and timing; the rebranding checklist later in this README owns
the concrete defaults and file locations.

<!-- i18n: common-commands -->

<!-- i18n: project-layout -->

## Project layout and runtime boundaries

```text
apps/
  desktop/        Electrobun app: Bun main process and React renderer
packages/
  shared/         Framework-neutral filesystem and window-state utilities
  ui/             Shared React components, design tokens, and UI primitives
scripts/
  release.ts      Version, tag, and release-push workflow
```

The Bun process owns native capabilities. The renderer requests those
capabilities through the typed RPC contract in
`apps/desktop/src/shared/rpc.ts`; it must not import Bun-only modules.
Cross-boundary user actions use the command definitions in
`apps/desktop/src/shared/commands.ts`.

<!-- i18n: localization -->

## Bilingual localization

The app shell supports only `en-US` and `zh-CN`. The Bun process is the single
source of truth for locale. On first launch, every Chinese system-locale variant
maps to `zh-CN` and every other locale maps to `en-US`; the selection is written
to `settings/locale.json` below the application data directory (by default,
`~/.electrobun-app-starter/settings/locale.json`) and takes precedence on later
launches.

The renderer reads its initial value through the typed `getLocale` RPC, submits
preference changes through `setLocale`, and subscribes to `localeChanged`. After
a successful switch, the React shell, command palette, and update copy refresh,
the document root's `lang`/`dir` attributes are synchronized, and the Bun
process rebuilds the native menus with the same locale. No application restart
is required. If renderer localization initialization fails, the startup error
screen displays English and Chinese together so the failure and retry action
remain understandable.

Translation resources live under
`apps/desktop/src/shared/i18n/resources/{en-US,zh-CN}/` and are split into the
`common`, `settings`, `menu`, `commands`, and `updates` JSON namespaces. When
adding or changing user-visible copy:

1. Add the same key to the same namespace in both locale directories.
2. Use `useTranslation` in React components and the translation function from
   `apps/desktop/src/bun/i18n` for Bun-native menus or dialogs.
3. Do not translate command discriminants, RPC names, log fields, or persisted
   enum values.
4. Run `mise run typecheck` for strict key typing and
   `bun test apps/desktop/src/shared/i18n/index.test.ts` for namespace, key, and
   supported-locale parity.

<!-- i18n: customize -->

## Customize the starter

The main product surface is
`apps/desktop/src/app/page.tsx`. Replace its placeholders with your own
application UI and add capabilities behind the existing RPC and command
boundaries.

### Required rebranding before the first release

This checklist is the detailed source of truth for Starter defaults, file
locations, secrets, permissions, and artifact configuration; follow the
[Create a new app from the Starter guide](../CREATE_YOUR_APP_EN.md) for
execution order and timing. The current values are starter defaults, not
production values for your product.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.brand-identity -->

#### Brand and application identity

- [ ] Replace every PNG in `apps/desktop/icon.iconset`. Keep the existing
      macOS iconset filenames and dimensions, and confirm
      `build.mac.icons: "icon.iconset"` in
      `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts` still points to it.
- [ ] Change the application name in
      `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts` (`app.name`, currently
      `Electrobun App Starter`) and all user-visible copies in
      `apps/desktop/src/mainview/index.html`,
      `apps/desktop/src/bun/app/window.ts`, and both locale directories under
      `apps/desktop/src/shared/i18n/resources/`. Synchronize every new or changed
      user-visible brand string across the `en-US` and `zh-CN` catalogs, then
      pass strict key typechecking and the locale parity tests.
- [ ] Assign a bundle identifier owned by your organization in
      `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts` (`app.identifier`, currently
      `com.shallinta.electrobun-app-starter`). Treat it as permanent after release
      because installed applications and updater state are identified by it.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.packages-local-state -->

#### Packages and local state

- [ ] Rename the root workspace package (`name` in `package.json`) and the
      `@shallinta/desktop`, `@shallinta/shared`, and `@shallinta/ui` packages in
      their respective `package.json` files. If you change the `@shallinta` scope,
      update all imports and dependencies under `apps/` and `packages/`, then run
      `bun install` so `bun.lock` matches the renamed workspace packages.
- [ ] Give the product its own data directory and override variable in
      `packages/shared/src/server/paths.ts` (currently
      `~/.electrobun-app-starter` and `ELECTROBUN_APP_STARTER_HOME`). Update the
      matching tests, `.gitignore`, the `.electrobun-app-starter/**` ignore in
      `eslint.config.js`, and the path references in `AGENTS.md` and the READMEs.
- [ ] Rename the application-owned `ELECTROBUN_APP_STARTER_*` environment
      prefix everywhere, including `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts`,
      `apps/desktop/src/bun/env/hydrate.ts`,
      `apps/desktop/scripts/serve-feed.ts`, `packages/shared/src/server/paths.ts`,
      `mise.toml`, and tests. Do not rename Electrobun's own
      `ELECTROBUN_DEVELOPER_ID` or `ELECTROBUN_APPLEAPI*` variables unless the
      Electrobun interface itself changes. This application prefix also covers
      the development/build selectors
      `ELECTROBUN_APP_STARTER_DESKTOP_RENDERER` and
      `ELECTROBUN_APP_STARTER_CDP_PORT`.
- [ ] Namespace browser persistence for the new product. Replace
      `electrobun-app-starter-theme`, `electrobun-app-starter-primary`, and
      `electrobun-app-starter:sidebar-size` in
      `packages/ui/src/lib/local-storage.ts`; also update the theme and primary
      color keys used by the pre-React bootstrap in
      `apps/desktop/src/mainview/index.html`.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.repository-artifacts -->

#### Repository and release artifacts

- [ ] Choose the public artifact prefix and DMG filename. Electrobun derives its
      intermediate artifact names from `app.name`; the versioned release renames
      installers with `rename_dmgs artifacts/regular ElectrobunAppStarter` in
      `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Replace that prefix, the example filenames,
      and the release install text in the same workflow.
- [ ] Replace the GitHub owner/repository and product links. The fixed URLs are
      in `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts` (`RELEASE_DOWNLOADS` and the `updates`
      feed), `apps/desktop/src/bun/app/menu.ts` (`DOCS_URL`, `HOMEPAGE_URL`, and
      `REPOSITORY_URL`), `apps/desktop/src/components/update-status-provider.tsx`
      (`RELEASE_TAG_URL`), and `scripts/release.ts` (the release Actions URL).
      Also update this README's product links as needed. The release workflow uses
      GitHub's `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` for repository-relative release and changelog
      links, so verify it runs in the new repository.
- [ ] Set the intended first version in `apps/desktop/package.json` and add its
      matching `## [x.y.z]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`. `.versionrc.json` and
      `scripts/release.ts` bump that package, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
      requires tag `v{x.y.z}` to match it and uses the matching changelog section
      as release notes.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.apple-release -->

#### Apple signing and notarization

- [ ] Provision a **Developer ID Application** certificate for your own Apple
      Developer team and verify its Team ID. Export that certificate **with its
      private key** as a password-protected `.p12`, base64-encode it into the
      `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` GitHub Actions secret, and store its password in
      `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` imports the `.p12`,
      extracts its signing identity, and exports `ELECTROBUN_DEVELOPER_ID`; there
      is no separate Team ID setting in the current workflow.
- [ ] Create App Store Connect notarization credentials for the same
      organization and configure the GitHub Actions secrets consumed by
      `.github/workflows/release.yml`: `ASC_API_KEY_P8`, `ASC_API_KEY_ID`, and
      `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`. Run a signed build and confirm the workflow's
      `codesign`, `spctl`, and `stapler` checks pass.

Never reuse the starter maintainer's certificate, Team ID, private key, App
Store Connect key, or GitHub secrets. This repository does not include signing
private keys; each downstream publisher must provision and protect its own.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.system-capabilities -->

#### System capabilities

- [ ] If the downstream app uses protected macOS resources or additional
      capabilities, add the required entries under `build.mac.entitlements` in
      `apps/desktop/electrobun.config.ts`. For entitlements that Electrobun maps
      to an `NS*UsageDescription` key, use the exact user-facing purpose string as
      the entitlement value, then validate both the entitlements and generated
      `Info.plist` in the signed app. This starter adds no product-specific
      permissions, so select them for the downstream product rather than copying
      them by assumption.

<!-- i18n: rebrand.license-attribution -->

#### License and downstream attribution

- [ ] Keep the upstream copyright notice in `LICENSE` when adding downstream
      attribution.

After replacing the defaults, search for leftovers before the first release:

```bash
rg -n 'shallinta|electrobun-app-starter|Electrobun App Starter|ElectrobunAppStarter|com\.shallinta|ELECTROBUN_APP_STARTER'
```

<!-- i18n: releases -->

## Releases

The app version is stored in `apps/desktop/package.json`. The release commands
run preflight checks, create the version commit and tag, then push atomically:

```bash
mise run release
mise run release:canary
```

Use `mise run release -- --dry-run` to preview a release. See
[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.upstream.md) for architecture, release, and contribution
conventions.
